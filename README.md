# background-color-generator

What is it? 
A simple CSS linear-gradient background generator using JavaScript, which also includes a RANDOM gradient generator function. 

Why? 
It is one of my first exercises working towards understanding JavaScript - as part of a course by Andrei Neagoie on Udemy.
